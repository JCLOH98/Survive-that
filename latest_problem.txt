Survive that
1 is original
2 is backup plan

Solved - in Enemy System 1, there is still some problem with the enemy x-axis and y-axis movement due to camerax and cameray
Solved - in Survive That! (proto2), the collision between enemy and bullet is base of surface rect, instead of surface itself
(for collision can use pygame.Mask)
